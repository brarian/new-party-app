## How it Works
A user goes through the base questions which include:
- What type of party are you planning?
- Do you have a theme?
- What's your menu? 

Each question has a tip which helps guide the user in shaping what the type of party they want. After completing the questions the user is able to go to a checklist with provides tasks to complete by date. Users are able to prep for their party and keep track of what is done using the checklist to acheive an easy stress free party!
